# Latent Resonance: Facial Acoustics

**A computational instrument that transmutes facial micro-movements into generated audio spectrograms.**

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is a generative software system that interprets spatiotemporal data from the human face to navigate a machine-learning model trained on audio spectrograms. By combining **computer vision** with **generative audio synthesis**, it creates a feedback loop where the user performs "silent vocals" that the machine interprets into new, hallucinatory sounds.

**Core Concept:** The system adheres to the constraint of **non-representation**. The user’s body is never visualized. Instead, their physical presence is abstracted into the *parameters* of a sound wave—frequency, amplitude, and noise—visualized as a spectrogram and reconstructed into audio in real-time.

### 🛠 System Architecture

The pipeline consists of four distinct stages:

1.  **Input (Computer Vision):** A webcam captures the user. `MediaPipe` tracks 468 facial landmarks.
2.  **Translation (Regression):** Spatiotemporal features (velocity, jaw openness, head tilt) are extracted and mapped to a high-dimensional latent vector ($z$).
3.  **Generation (The Model):** A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) generates a unique $512 \times 512$ spectrogram image based on the input vector.
4.  **Reconstruction (Sonification):** The generated image is converted into audio using the **Griffin-Lim algorithm** (via `librosa`), estimating phase data to produce sound.

### 📂 The Dataset: "Visualizing the Invisible"

**Source Material:**
The model was trained on a custom-curated dataset of 435 spectrograms generated from audio samples sourced via [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) (cello, sustained tones, reese bass, and similar structured harmonic material).

**Curation Process:**
* **Audio Sourcing:** Samples were downloaded using the built-in freesound scraper (`latent-resonance-scraper`), filtering by duration and selecting sounds with clear harmonic structure.
* **Audio Processing:** Raw audio was batch-processed using `librosa.feature.melspectrogram`, producing 512x512 grayscale PNGs.
* **Normalization:** All spectrograms were converted to log-scale (dB) and normalized to a range of `[-1, 1]` to stabilize GAN training.
* **Learnings:** I discovered that "noisy" images (like white noise spectrograms) confuse the model, while structured harmonic sounds (like cello or speech) produce cleaner visual patterns.

### 🎮 Controls & Interaction

The system does not map 1:1 coordinates (e.g., "head left = sound left"). Instead, it maps **energy states**:

| Facial Action | Spatiotemporal Data | Sonic/Visual Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Head Rotation (Y-Axis)** | Angular Velocity | **Time-Stretch:** Controls the playback speed of the generated sample. |
| **Mouth Openness** | Distance (LipTop, LipBottom) | **Bandpass Filter:** Determines the frequency range (Mouth closed = Low pass; Open = Full spectrum). |
| **Eyebrow Tension** | Distance (Brow, Eye) | **Noise/Entropy:** Adds jitter to the latent vector, introducing digital glitches/static. |
| **Stillness** | $\Delta$ Position $\approx 0$ | **Clarity:** The model settles on a "pure" tone. |

### 🧠 Technical Challenges & Learnings

1. The "Phase" Problem

    Challenge: Standard spectrogram images only store amplitude (loudness) information, discarding phase (timing). This meant my initial generated sounds were "muddy" and lacked definition.

    Solution: I implemented the Griffin-Lim algorithm to iteratively estimate the phase signal. While computationally expensive for real-time use, it provided the necessary clarity to make the sounds recognizable.

2. Latent Space Mapping

    Challenge: Mapping facial coordinates (x,y,z) directly to GAN inputs often resulted in chaotic, flashing images.

    Solution: I used a smoothing function (Linear Interpolation) on the input vector. This allows the sound to "morph" slowly rather than snapping instantly, creating a fluid, drone-like aesthetic.

3. Training the GAN: Trial and Error

    I chose **StyleGAN3-t** (translation-equivariant) for its suitability with spectrograms, where the horizontal axis represents time and translation equivariance preserves temporal structure.

    **Colab attempt (single T4):** My first attempt was on Google Colab with a single Tesla T4 GPU. StyleGAN3's custom CUDA ops (`bias_act`, `upfirdn2d`, `filtered_lrelu`) failed to compile — the fused kernels expect a build environment that Colab doesn't provide out of the box. I had to patch the ops to fall back to native PyTorch reference implementations, which are significantly more memory-hungry. This forced me to drastically reduce the model: `cbase=8192`, `cmax=128`, `batch=2` — a quarter of the default capacity — just to fit in the T4's 15 GB VRAM. Training ran for 1000 kimg but Colab's session time limits made long runs unreliable.

    **PyTorch compatibility patches:** StyleGAN3's codebase hasn't been updated for recent PyTorch versions. I had to manually patch two breaking changes: `InfiniteSampler` passing `dataset` to the `Sampler` superclass (removed in PyTorch 2.4), and Adam optimizer receiving integer betas `[0, 0.99]` instead of floats (rejected since PyTorch 2.9).

    **Kaggle attempt (T4 x2):** To get longer uninterrupted training, I moved to Kaggle which offers dual T4 GPUs and longer session limits. I initially configured multi-GPU training (`--gpus=2`) but ran into issues and fell back to single-GPU mode. The same CUDA ops compilation problem occurred, requiring the same native fallback and reduced model capacity. I trained for 5000 kimg on Kaggle, which produced usable results.

    **What I learned:** Free-tier GPU platforms are viable for GAN training but require significant adaptation. The gap between "paper configurations" and what actually runs on a T4 with native ops is large — I ended up using roughly 1/4 of the model's intended capacity. Despite this, the 435-spectrogram dataset was small enough that the reduced model could still learn meaningful structure. Structured harmonic source material (cello, sustained tones) trained noticeably better than percussive or noisy samples.

    Training notebooks are available in the `notebooks/` folder: `train_stylegan3.ipynb` (Colab) and `train_stylegan3_kaggle.ipynb` (Kaggle).
